We need one file for testing our algo, i.e. it takes a maze as input (in the form of a 16x16 array of data structure to be defined in the main.c file) and gives a path as output.And one main.c file.
2 people can first design the utility file which checks the software.
rest two can design the exploration and path finding algo as of now.
Please suggest changes and keep updating files.
